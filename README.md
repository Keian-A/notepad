# Notepad

Going back to the age-old, solved a billion times over application, with my own thoughts and code. No looking online for help, all myself and personal knowledge!

## Final result:

I used React Redux Toolkit to manage the state of notes where I used 2 reducer methods defined in `src/store/notes.js`, `add` as well as `remove` which added, and removed a note from state, respectively.

For styling I used React Bootstrap. I used my own css files for small tweaks to the css.

I implemented a feature to keep local storage for the array of notes, so a user can refresh the page, or come back at a later date with persisted data.
